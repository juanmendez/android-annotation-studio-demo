# Android Annotations (Kotlin-Databinding) demo

Three years ago this repository was made to show how to use Android Annotations with Android Studio.
Now it has been turned around to show how to use it with Kotlin along with Databinding.

I made this new branch because like others I also had some issues to make this work around.

This demo is using `kotlinOpen` so as you remember Android Annotations makes subclasses of your
activities and fragments, so by default to inherit you need to imply `open` in your classes for that
to work. So that's a way to save you from doing it every time. You don't have to use it.

I also made this demo flavors, and debug suffix friendly.

It's been more than three years since I discovered [Android-Annotations](http://androidannotations.org/) and is one of my favorite
Android libraries. I am so grateful for those who have contributed and keep it running.
